# Workshop: Using `geoparquet` with R

[*UC Davis DataLab*](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/)\

*Spring 2023*\

*Instructor/Maintainer: Ryan Peek \<[rapeek\@ucdavis.edu](mailto:rapeek@ucdavis.edu)\>*\

A short demo of using `parquet` files in a geospatial format (`geoparquet`) in R. These file types are great for large vector-based spatial datasets (100 MB's) and can provide additional ways to integrate with other database approaches (i.e., Arrow or similar).

There is a short overview and two examples that can be run to demonstrate the power and speed of using these file types.
